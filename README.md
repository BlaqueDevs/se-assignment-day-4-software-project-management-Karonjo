## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
To fullfill customer satisfaction:Timely delivery ensures that the software meets the client's expectations and is available for use when needed, which helps maintain strong business relationships and trust.
Cost control:When you exceed the allocated time it can lead to increased costs due to extended resource usage, increased staffing, or penalties for not meeting deadlines.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Profitability: Controlling costs ensures that the project stays within its budget, which directly impacts the profitability of the project. 
Resource Optimization: Effective cost control ensures that resources are used efficiently, preventing wasteful expenditure on tasks that do not add value to the project.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
On the development approach, agile is Iterative and incremental and development occurs in sprints or iterations, allowing for continuous feedback and changes while in water fall its Linear and sequential. Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, etc.) must be completed before moving to the next.
Advantages of Agile 
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows for quick adjustments to changing requirements or market conditions, making it ideal for projects where the scope is not fully known from the outset.
Client Collaboration: Regular involvement of clients and stakeholders ensures that the product aligns closely with business needs and customer expectations.
Disadvantages of Agile 
Less Predictable Costs and Timelines: The iterative nature of Agile can lead to difficulty in predicting the final budget or project timeline due to ongoing changes.
Requires Strong Team Collaboration: Agile heavily relies on effective communication and collaboration. 
Advantages of Waterfall 
Clear Structure and Predictability: The linear nature of Waterfall makes it easier to plan, with clear milestones, timelines, and budgets established from the outset.
Thorough Documentation: The extensive documentation required ensures that all requirements and designs are well defined, which helps in maintaining project clarity and accountability.

Disadvantages of Waterfall
Inflexibility: Waterfall’s rigidity makes it difficult to accommodate changes once development begins, leading to potential problems if client needs evolve during the project.
Late Testing: Testing occurs only after the development phase, meaning defects or issues might not be discovered until later stages, making them harder and more costly to resolve.
